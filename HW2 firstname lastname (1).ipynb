    "**The second line re writes beta hat as the expected value of beta hat and the yi - y bar as the conditional expected value of itself given x. This allows us to break this term down into multiple components in line 3 (expected value of yi given x and expected value of y bar given x). Line 4 re writes the expected value of yi given x as the equation it represents (alpha plus xi * beta plus epsilon). Line 5 rewrites the expected value of y bar given x as alpha plus x bar * beta. These operations and substitutions will help us cancel values. Line 6 seperates the expected value of yi given x equation into two seperate expected values, this is because we know the expected value of epsilon is zero due to Gauss Markov assumptions. In line 8, we know that the expected values of the two terms in the numerator are themselves. Since they share a common factor, beta, we combine the two componetns as one and multiply by beta. Since beta is a constant, we can take it out of the summation. Now we have a fraction of two identical values, which turns into the value one and leaves beta left.**"
